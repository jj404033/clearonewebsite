                    <p  style="color: #ffffff;">The University of Waterloo, founded in 1959 in Ontario, enrolls around 40,000 students across its main and auxiliary campuses in Waterloo, Cambridge, Kitchener, and Stratford. 
                        The main campus features eight student residences, with additional housing provided at affiliated colleges. Each year, the number of students enrolled are increasing (12% increase in the past 5 years). The need for establishing a residence for visitors has never been greater. In assessing potential issues for our proposed land site, situated near the Minota Hagey Residence, we reviewed feedback from previous and current upper-year students residing there. Our findings highlight a considerable concern with vehicles speeding on Ring Road and MHR's access road. This frequent speeding results in a disturbance, mainly due to the vehicular noise which is particularly disruptive to visitors during late evening hours, a time when quiet is most needed for rest.

                    <p  style="color: #000000;">Our proposed design respects the existing topography and the natural landscape of the site. We meticulously planned our roadways to avoid disruption to critical infrastructure, ensuring that not a single fire hydrant is compromised. Furthermore, our commitment to preserving the environment is demonstrated by our minimal tree removal policy; for any tree we had to cut, we've implemented a robust replanting strategy to maintain the ecological balance. Accessibility has been a key consideration, with site curbs designed to enable “easy-in, easy-out,” accommodating emergency vehicles such as fire trucks, as well as larger vehicles required for building operations. The positioning of parking lots and the building itself was deliberately chosen to align with flatter sections of the terrain, avoiding areas with closely spaced contour lines, to minimize the impact on the land and reduce the need for extensive earthworks. This careful planning underscores our dedication to creating a project that is both environmentally considerate and operationally efficient.

This strategic choice is instrumental in mitigating the inherent steepness of the site, yielding a noticeable benefit.

Concurrently, it significantly improves accessibility, providing a seamless experience for individuals navigating the space.

                        The diagram represents an urban tree planting technique, focusing on the health of the tree within a paved environment. It incorporates a base layer with a "-2%" grade that serves multiple functions. Firstly, it facilitates drainage, directing water away from the tree to prevent the pooling that could lead to root diseases. Secondly, it plays a role in water management, channeling surplus water into a reservoir that can be drawn upon during dry spells, ensuring the tree's hydration. Thirdly, it aids in maintaining root health by preventing the accumulation of surface water that could suffocate the roots, promoting deeper water penetration into the soil. Lastly, this design feature helps protect the infrastructure by reducing the likelihood of water freezing and expanding beneath pavements, thereby preventing potential damage. This integrated approach not only supports the vitality of the tree but also safeguards the surrounding man-made structures.

                    <p style="color: #ffffff;">Given that the Hagey Harmony Homes primarily hosts visitors unfamiliar with the University of Waterloo layout, it is essential to install directional signage pointing in and out the main buildings. This will enhance navigational ease for newcomers. 
<br><br>Our design prioritizes pedestrian safety and accessibility, with a zebra crossing, tactile paving for the visually impaired, and aesthetic landscaping. The area is well-lit, ensuring visibility, and the car is depicted stopping behind the crossing, indicating a respect for traffic rules and pedestrian space.

                    <p  style="color: #000000;">Our proposal takes a forward-thinking approach to environmental sustainability, particularly emphasizing the promotion of electric vehicle (EV) use. By dedicating specific parking spots for EVs, we not only provide convenience for eco-conscious drivers but also actively encourage the adoption of cleaner transportation alternatives. These designated spots are strategically located near charging stations, offering a clear incentive for individuals to consider electric vehicles over traditional combustion engines. Through this effort, we aim to contribute to the creation of a greener, more sustainable future, making it easier and more attractive for the community to participate in environmental stewardship.

                    <p style="color: #ffffff;">The image shown is a schematic representation of a designed urban tree planting structure that integrates various layers to promote healthy tree growth within a paved environment. Starting from the top, the vegetation layer contains the tree and potentially low-lying plants or grass. Beneath this is the substrate layer composed of 300 mm of soil, which provides the necessary nutrients and root support for the tree. Directly underneath the substrate is the root-resistant layer, which serves to protect surrounding infrastructure from potential damage by tree roots. Below this is an excess water reservoir designed to manage surplus water, ensuring the tree's hydration needs are met. The base layer forms the foundation of the structure. The entire configuration is oriented with a -2% slope to guide excess water away, promoting efficient drainage and preventing water from accumulating around the tree base, which could lead to root rot or other water-related diseases. Our group took account of health of the tree as well as the integrity of the urban infrastructure into consideration.
