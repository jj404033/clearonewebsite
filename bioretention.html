                    <p  style="color: #000000;">
                        The implementation of the physical bioretention model involved a thoughtful selection of materials to optimize its environmental impact. ABS pipe, chosen for its eco-friendly characteristics compared to PVC, served as the structural framework. Gravel played a crucial role in promoting drainage and preventing clogging, while sand facilitated additional filtration. Charcoal/carbon acted as an absorbent to capture impurities and contaminants effectively. Filter fiber further refined water quality by trapping smaller particles. Integrating plants such as bamboo and fern not only contributed to the model's aesthetics but also played a vital role in phytoremediation, enhancing water purification through the plants' natural filtering capabilities. Lastly, the inclusion of dirt provided a substrate for plant growth and supported the overall biological functions of the system. This comprehensive choice of materials aimed to create a holistic and efficient bioretention model capable of addressing various pollutants and fostering a sustainable, eco-friendly solution for marine ecosystems.

                    <p  style="color: #ffffff;">The installation of the ABS pipe within the bioretention model followed a strategic sequence to ensure optimal functionality. Beginning with the bin, two sizable holes were carefully created at the bottom to accommodate the ABS pipe's passage. Subsequently, a three-way joint was introduced, serving as a pivotal connection point for integration into the overflow system. To enhance the safety and efficiency of the pipes, carefully positioned holes were added to prevent any potential for bursting while simultaneously facilitating the efficient collection of filtered water. This meticulous approach in installing the ABS pipe system underscored a commitment to both structural integrity and operational effectiveness within the bioretention model. Throughout each process, we used silicon glue to ensure everything is sealed and in the right place.

                    <p  style="color: #000000;">The layering system within the bioretention model was designed to make an effective water filtration process, combining elements from both standard bioretention practices and clean water filter systems. The foundation of the layering comprised gravel, serving as the initial filtration barrier to prevent clogging and facilitate efficient drainage. Above the gravel layer, a specialized filtering layer was incorporated, inspired by conventional bioretention systems, to trap larger debris and contaminants. Charcoal, recognized for its absorbent properties, followed suit, providing an additional layer of purification by capturing impurities. Subsequently, sand was introduced, acting as a fine filter to further refine water quality. Finally, the top layer consisted of dirt, creating a substrate for plant growth and facilitating the biological processes inherent to traditional bioretention systems. This innovative process of standard bioretention and clean water filter layers resulted in a comprehensive and efficient filtration system, demonstrating a synergistic approach to water purification within the bioretention model.

                        Aligned with conventional bioretention principles, our model incorporated an efficient overflow control system to manage excess water. A fundamental filter was strategically integrated to ensure that overflow water seamlessly directed into the ABS pipes. This simple yet effective measure served a dual purpose: it prevented potential flooding by controlling the volume of water within the system, and concurrently, it allowed for the swift and direct passage of excess water through the ABS pipes. The overflow control system underscored our commitment to maintaining a balanced water level within the bioretention model while facilitating the smooth operation of the overall filtration process. This implication referenced from established practices in bioretention design, contributing to the sustainability and functionality of our model in reducing the impact of pollutants on marine ecosystems.

                        In addition to the functional aspects of the bioretention model, aesthetics were considered a valuable component, contributing to both visual appeal and the overall effectiveness of the system. To enhance the model's appearance, we incorporated carefully selected plants and small rocks. However, our choice of vegetation extended beyond mere aesthetics; we strategically opted for ferns and bamboo due to their exceptional bioretention properties. Ferns possess a natural affinity for water absorption, aiding in the filtration process by capturing and utilizing excess water. Bamboo, on the other hand, is renowned for its ability to thrive in various soil conditions, contributing to stabilizing the substrate while actively participating in the phytoremediation process. This intentional selection of plants not only added a visually pleasing dimension to the bioretention model but also reinforced its ecological functionality, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between aesthetics and environmental sustainability.

                    <p style="color: #ffffff;">
                        The polluted water used in our bioretention model mirrored real-world environmental challenges, incorporating a range of contaminants. The water source included a mixture of microplastics and metal scraps, representing pollutants that significantly impact marine ecosystems. Microplastics, obtained from the breakdown of plastic products, pose a severe threat to aquatic life, while metal scraps contribute to water contamination through industrial runoff and other human activities. To mimic the acidity commonly associated with polluted water, lemons were introduced, lowering the pH level to a range of 3-4. This acidic condition is often observed in bodies of water affected by industrial discharges or acid rain, further underscoring the diverse challenges our bioretention model aimed to address. Additionally, cooking oil was incorporated to simulate the presence of engine oil or similar substances, clarifying the need for effective filtration methods to combat the detrimental effects of oil-based pollutants on aquatic environments.

                        The filter came out successful as our bioretention model showcased a significant transformation of polluted water into a filtered, ideal state suitable for marine life. The slightly brownish hue observed in the filtered water was attributed to the presence of the top dirt layer, emphasizing the effectiveness of the layered filtration system in trapping impurities. Crucially, the absence of microplastics underscored the model's efficacy in addressing this pervasive pollutant, offering a promising solution to mitigate its harmful impact on marine ecosystems. Importantly, the absence of steel parts further affirmed the model's ability to eliminate metal scraps and other contaminants, ensuring the production of water that is not only clear but also ecologically sound and conducive to the well-being of marine life.

                        In conclusion, our bioretention model stands as a holistic solution to water pollution, offering a strategic blend of innovative design and functional efficiency. The layered filtration system, inspired by both standard bioretention and clean water filter practices, showcases a thoughtful integration of materials like eco-friendly ABS pipes, gravel, charcoal, sand, and dirt. The inclusion of ferns and bamboo enhances both aesthetics and bioretention capabilities. The overflow control system prevents flooding, ensuring a balanced water level. Simulated tests with pollutants demonstrate the model's efficacy, resulting in filtered water with a neutral pH of 7-8, free from microplastics and steel parts. This project signifies a meaningful step towards sustainable water management, providing a promising solution to combat contemporary environmental challenges and foster the well-being of marine life.
